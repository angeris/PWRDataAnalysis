When it collapses all of them are going to hit this point, which means that each point has to travel this distance. It travels with a kind of projection of the velocity towards a kind of projection towards the center at every time point. So this is 30 degrees, so you move towards here with velocity v center which is projection of v on this axis, which is v times cosine 30, and the distance which it needs to travel to this line, which is, how long is it. what is the side of the triangle? d, so this guy is d half let’s call the length l which each point needs to travel so l is d half divided by cosine 30 which is […] so if you travel at this speed you will have to cover this distance which is […] then I’m going to have d over v and two thirds.

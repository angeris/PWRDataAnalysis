okay equilateral length side have particle draw velocity vector going towards initial position will going toward will going that left towards will going left towards theyre going going draw them where half initial position halfway going upside down triangle theyre moving same speed velocity vectors will look relatively same because theyre going same speed theyre relatively spaced thinking something with okay degrees theta equals sixty degrees between each going same speed okay meters second wait necessarily meters second almost like take velocity each instant intuition correct looks like almost going circle together slowly collapsing circle

Okay it’s equilateral, length side d. So we have particle A, I’ll draw the velocity vector, going towards B so initial position will be going toward B and B will be going that way to the left towards C and C will be going up and to the left towards A. So as they’re going so I’m going to draw them where A is half way to B’s initial position and B is halfway to C, so it’s going to be an upside down triangle. So they’re all moving at the same speed. So all the velocity vectors will look relatively the same because they’re all going the same speed and they’re all relatively spaced. I’m thinking it has something to do with okay so it’s 60 degrees so theta equals sixty degrees between each one and it’s going at the same speed okay so d meters per second, wait it’s not necessarily d meters per second. So it’s almost like if you take the velocity at each instant, if my intuition is correct it looks like it’s almost going in a circle together in a slowly collapsing circle.

So basically we know that the speed is the same, so technically throughout time they will collapse to one point since they’re all going towards each other, so the question is to find how long does the triangle take to collapse to a single point. Point B has velocity, so B along BC so all the points are going in the same direction. Okay, so all points have the same velocity with respect to the point which they are trying to reach. So now to find the time, we know that t is equal to d over v so we have to know the distance covered at each distance. Okay so you just find the projection of the speed so you know okay so A is going to be closer to B the distance that they go is v times t. So if B is going to move B times so it’s just going to be vt.

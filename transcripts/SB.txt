I’m imagining the points are moving in a circle, and I have to figure out how long it takes to collapse into a single point. I’m thinking of vectors, let me try drawing this out. So I’m redrawing the triangle and I’m trying to draw different stages of it at time t equals 0 and at time t equals x. And they always maintain the shape of an equilateral triangle? Oh wait, no, they collapse to a single point. So they’re going to make these curves. So I’m imagining these points sort of spiraling into a central location. Okay what information do we have? We have the distance between them at d. Given this information they are going to spiral to the center of the triangle which will be at position
